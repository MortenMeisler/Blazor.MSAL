# Blazor MSAL with Azure DevOps API
This is a sample project showing how to configure MSAL Authentication in Blazor WebAssembly against Azure DevOps API

## Setup
This project is based on the Microsoft Doc [Secure an ASP.NET Core Blazor WebAssembly standalone app with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/blazor/webassembly/standalone-with-azure-active-directory?view=aspnetcore-3.1)

What is added is code showing how to use the same access token from the MSAL flow to consume Azure DevOps API. 

The important part from `AzureDevOpsClient.cs`:
```
var tokenResult = await _authenticationService.RequestAccessToken(
           new AccessTokenRequestOptions
           {
               //Azure Devops default scope - constant, do not change.
               Scopes = new[] {
                    "499b84ac-1321-427f-aa17-267ca6975798/.default",
            }
           });
```

And from my Azure App:

Make sure to replace with your client and tenant id in Program.cs

```
 builder.Services.AddMsalAuthentication(options =>
            {
                var authentication = options.ProviderOptions.Authentication;

                // Tenant Id
                authentication.Authority = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{yourtenantid}";

                // Application / Client Id
                authentication.ClientId = "{yourclientid}";
            });
```

This should of course be retrieved from appsettings.json, but IConfiguration is not working yet from program.cs. Expected to be released in next preview.
